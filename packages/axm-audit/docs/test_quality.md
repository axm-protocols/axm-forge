# Test Quality Rules

The `test_quality` category surfaces rules that reason about the **test tree
itself** — what it imports, how it asserts, which fixtures do real I/O. Unlike
`testing` (which just gates coverage), `test_quality` rules guard against
brittleness: tests that couple to implementation details, tautological
asserts, or mock patterns that drift from production behavior.

Rules land incrementally; this page documents each as it ships.

## private-imports

**Rule ID**: `TEST_QUALITY_PRIVATE_IMPORTS`
**Class**: `axm_audit.core.rules.test_quality.PrivateImportsRule`
**Severity**: `ERROR`
**Score**: `max(0, 100 - n_violations * 5)`

Flags `tests/**/test_*.py` imports of `_prefixed` symbols from first-party
packages. Importing private helpers couples the test suite to implementation
details, so a simple refactor of a private function turns into a multi-file
chore.

### What it flags

For every test file the rule walks `ast.ImportFrom` nodes whose module starts
with a package under `src/`. Each imported symbol is inspected:

| Symbol shape      | Flagged? | Notes                                          |
| ----------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `_private`        | yes      | Classified via `axm_ast.extract_module_info`   |
| `_PrivateClass`   | yes      | Kind = `class`                                 |
| `_UPPER_CASE`     | no¹      | `_[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]+` matches — constants only    |
| `__dunder__`      | no       | Always skipped                                 |
| public name       | no       | Not `_`-prefixed                               |

¹ Set `include_constants=True` on the rule to surface `_UPPER_CASE` constants
as well. Each finding records `test_file`, `line`, `import_module`,
`private_symbol` and a `symbol_kind` (`function`, `class`, `constant`,
`variable`, `unknown`).

### Why it matters

- **Refactor friction** — renaming `_helper` should not break the test suite.
- **API honesty** — if a test needs `_private`, the symbol is probably part of
  the package's effective contract and should be exported (dropping the `_`)
  or replaced with a test-facing seam.
- **Review signal** — new private imports in tests often hide a missing
  abstraction.

### Configuration

```python
from axm_audit.core.rules.test_quality import PrivateImportsRule

# Also flag _UPPER_CASE constants (default: ignored)
rule = PrivateImportsRule(include_constants=True)
```

### Fix recipes

- Export the symbol: drop the `_` prefix and add it to the package
  `__all__` / `__init__.py`.
- Pull the helper into a test-only fixture or factory.
- Move the assertion one layer up so it exercises the public entry point.
